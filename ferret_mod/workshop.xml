	<Mod
		name="FerretMod"
		description="Add Ferrets from the Ferret rescue ran by PirateSoftware to the game, either as friends or as enemies!
		You can configure how the ferrets behave from the mod config.
		By default ferrets are friends that don't attack you, but this also means they don't reward you for attacking them!
		There's also some twitch integration events added so chat can join in on the fun!

		Find the github repo at https://github.com/RedBrumbler/Noita-FerretMod if you're interested in how this mod is made.
		Go Make Games! And watch the ferrets at http://ferrets.live"
